Logical Operators: If you want to use multiple conditions
	 1. AND
	 2. OR
	 3. not
	 
	 SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE SALARY >15000 AND JOB_ID = 'AD_VP';---BOTH should be satisfied
	 
	 SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE SALARY >15000 OR JOB_ID = 'AD_VP';----> ANY ONE can satify
	 
	 SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE NOT FIRST_NAME = 'DAVID';--->OTHER THAN DAVID, WE get all values
	 ====================================================================================================
	 
BETWEEN and "not BETWEEN":

 SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE SALARY BETWEEN 1000 AND 2000;
 SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE SALARY >=1000  AND <=2000;
 SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE SALARY not BETWEEN 1000 AND 2000;
 '
 
 
 ====================================================================================================================
 
 "IN " and "NOT IN"
 
  SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE SALARY= 4000 OR SALARY= 1000 OR SALARY=2000;
  
  Instead of abocve query we can use
  SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE SALARY IN(4000,1000,2000);

  PATTERN MATCHING
  
 
  
  SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE FISRT_NAME LIKE 'S%';==========> character starts with S ..eg: sara, sruti
  
   SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE FISRT_NAME LIKE '%r';============> character should ends with R
   
    SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE FISRT_NAME LIKE 'S%r';----------> firstname is 'S' and lastname is 'r'
	
	
	SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE FISRT_NAME NOT LIKE 'S%';--------> who name not start with S%
	
	
	SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE FISRT_NAME LIKE '%e_';----> % represent many char, and '_' represent one char, so last butone should be char e eg: Lex
	
	SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE FISRT_NAME LIKE '___';-------> 3 spaces, so 3 characters name it will display
	
	
	
	'_' ---> single underscore ---> one char
	'____'----> many underscore----> many char
