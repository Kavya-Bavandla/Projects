Past, files, excels they use to store


1. DBMS-------> store the data in tables---(eg:Dbase, Foxpro MS access etc)
2. RDBMS ---> In order to place the relation btwn the tables(eg: Oracle, MY-SQL Server, DB2, My Sql, MS-Acces etc.......)


Even the RDBMS is unable to store the Data. To MAINTAIN huge data, BIG Data (Spark)came into Market


1. What is Database? Data Storage Area

GUI(Scripting Lang)--->WEBLOGIC(Programming Lang)---->DB(Oracle)


2. What is SQL? Structed query Lang, used to communicate with DB, to perform different kind of operations
In order to interact with DB, we need SQL(designed by ANCI Comapny) Lang.

3. Database Components (Client, server software)

	1 Client: To perform certain actions , sends the request.
		2 types of Client:
			1. GUI (SQL Developer)
			2. Command Line interface (SQL Plus)
			
			
		For MySQL---->MySQLWorkbencH(gui)
			MySQL---->MYSQLcOMMADNlINETOOL    (cOMMAND lINE Interface)
	
	
	2.Server: It is responsible for storing the data. (Remote machine)
	
	
Both can be in same or differnt systems. 90% Server will be installed on unix/linux OS
