GROUP_BY CLASS: Grouping the results from a TABLE

In a table,  need sum of sal of employee, who belongs to each department.

	 SELECT DEPARTMENT_ID SUM(SALARY) FROM employee; // sum of salary of whole TABLE
	 
	 SELECT DEPARTMENT_ID,SUM(SALARY) FROM employee GROUP BY DEPARTMENT_ID; // sum of salary for specific DEPARTMENT
	 
	 SELECT DEPARTMENT_ID,AVG(SALARY) FROM employee GROUP BY DEPARTMENT_ID; // AVG of salary for specific DEPARTMENT
	 
	  SELECT DEPARTMENT_ID,MAX(SALARY), MIN(SALARY), FROM employee GROUP BY DEPARTMENT_ID; //max and min sal of department
	  
	  
In a table, how many employee people are working iN job_id

	SELECT JOB_ID COUNT(*)  FROM EMPLOYEE GROUP BY JOB_ID;
	SELECT JOB_ID, DEPARTMENT_ID COUNT(*)  FROM EMPLOYEE GROUP BY JOB_ID, DEPARTMENT_ID;

======================================================================================================================================
	
HAVING CLASS: perform certain conditions Applied on GROUPED class

	wANT TO PRINT the data if count is >20
	
	SELECT JOB_ID COUNT(*)  FROM EMPLOYEE GROUP BY JOB_ID HAVING COUNT(*)>20 ;
	
	SELECT DEPARTMENT_ID,SUM(SALARY) FROM employee GROUP BY DEPARTMENT_ID HAVING sum(salary)>20000;
	===============================================================================================================================
	
	
	WHERE CLASS:  Before group class we can apply where class
	
	SELECT DEPARTMENT_ID,SUM(SALARY) FROM employee WHERE DEPARTMENT_ID<>50 GROUP BY DEPARTMENT_ID ; //displays except 50
	
	<>= not equal to 
	
	SELECT DEPARTMENT_ID,SUM(SALARY) FROM employee WHERE DEPARTMENT_ID<>50 GROUP BY DEPARTMENT_ID HAVING sum(SALARY)>10000;


================================================================================================================================================



ORDER_BY class: SORTED 

	SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE ORDER BY DEPARTMENT_ID desc;
	SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE ORDER BY DEPARTMENT_ID desc;
	
=============================================================================================================================

Below is the Complete Query, in which we see usage of all classes

SELECT DEPARTMENT_ID, SUM(SALARY) FROM employee
WHERE DEPARTMENT_ID<100>
GROUP BY DEPARTMENT_ID
HAVING SUM(SALARY)>2000
ORDER BY SUM(SALARY)DESC;


==================================================================================

ORDER OF execution:

SELECT column names 
	FROM employee
		WHERE condition
			GROUP BY columnnames
				HAVING condition
					ORDER BY column-names
