Set Operators: want to retrieve data from multiple tables

1.UNION
	
	 Rules:
		1.Each table , both tables shuld have same number of colmn. 
		2.same datatypes.
		3. While retriving the data, we need to follow same order.
		
	 
2.UNION ALL
3.INTERSECT--not supported in Mysql
4. MINUS--not supported in Mysql
	
	
	EG: table1 [1,3, 5]
		table2 [3, 5,6]
	
	UNION: All the data we can get from 2 tables, however it will eliminate the duplicates , o/p: [1,3,5,6]
	
	UNION ALL : All the data we can get from 2 tables, however it will give you duplicated data. o/p: [1,3,3,5,5,6]
	
	INTERSECT : It will extract only common data .[3,5]
	
	MINUS: T1-T2 , [1,6]
