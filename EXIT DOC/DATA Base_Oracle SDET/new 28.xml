  1. CREATE---> IF YOU WANT TO CREate anything we can userinput
		
		CREATE TABLE STUDENT (SID INT(4), SNAME VARCHAR(15));
	
	DESCRIBE STUDENT;
	
	
	INSERT INTO STUDENT VALUES(101, 'kAVYA');
	INSERT INTO STUDENT VALUES(102, 'Don');
	INSERT INTO STUDENT VALUES(103, 'Super');
	
	commit;
	
	
	2. ALTER---> rename , update, add the database
	
	ADD:
		ALTER TABLE STUDENT ADD (GRADE , VARCHAR(2));---> ADD NEw column
		ALTER TABLE STUDENT DROP COLUMN GRADE;---> drop existing COLUMN
	
	
	Update:
		ALTER TABLE STUDENT MODIFY COLUMN SNAME VARCHAR(20);---> increasing the size of SNAME
		If you want to decrease the size, we should first clear the data, and add new size
	
	RENAME:
		ALTER TABLE STUDENT RENAME COLUMN SNAME TO STUNAME;
		
	DROP: Everything is deleted (table gone)
	
	
	TRUNCATE: content is removed,, but rollback option is not present. but table structure is present 
	
	
	DELETE: content is removed, data can be rollback option is present.
