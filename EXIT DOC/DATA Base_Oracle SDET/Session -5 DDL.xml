  1. CREATE---> IF YOU WANT TO CREate anything we can userinput
		
		CREATE TABLE STUDENT (SID INT(4), SNAME VARCHAR(15));
	
	DESCRIBE STUDENT;
	
	
	INSERT INTO STUDENT VALUES(101, 'kAVYA');
	INSERT INTO STUDENT VALUES(102, 'Don');
	INSERT INTO STUDENT VALUES(103, 'Super');
	
	commit;
	
	
	2. ALTER---> rename , update, add the database
	
	ADD:
		ALTER TABLE STUDENT ADD (GRADE , VARCHAR(2));---> ADD NEw column
		ALTER TABLE STUDENT DROP COLUMN GRADE;---> drop existing COLUMN
	
	
	Update:
		ALTER TABLE STUDENT MODIFY COLUMN SNAME VARCHAR(20);---> increasing the size of SNAME
		If you want to decrease the size, we should first clear the data, and add new size
	
	RENAME THE colmn:
		ALTER TABLE STUDENT RENAME COLUMN SNAME TO STUNAME;
		
	DROP: Everything is deleted (table gone)
	
	
	TRUNCATE: content is removed,, but rollback option is not present. but table structure is present 
	
	
	DELETE: content is removed, data can be rollback option is present.
	
		
		
After insert, update, del---> you have to use "commit" to save the data
In MysQL, we have "autocommit =0,"----> we need to commit 
		 If we have autocommit=1 , it will automatically commit the data permanently



DELETE: (DML)

	SELECT * FROM STUDENT;------>you get data;
	DELETE * FROM STUDENT; ----->no data 
	rollback; ----> yu will get data as First
	Suppose, if you dont want to rollback and get the previus data, use "COMMMIT" after DEL query , THE DATA will be premanently deleted , 
	even if you rollback you will not get the data

===============================================================================

TRUNCATE: (DDL)

	SELECT * FROM STUDENT;------>you get data;
	TRUNCATE * FROM STUDENT; ----->data removed permanently
	rollback; ---> no data 
	
================================================
	
RENAME THE TABLE:

RENAME TABLE jobs to designations;

RENAME TABLE designations to jobs;
